## Data Storage & Privacy

Your privacy is paramount. **NBF Notes** stores all data locally on your device using a transparent file structure:

- **Desktop**: `%APPDATA%\nbf-notes` (Wiped on uninstall)
- **Mobile**: App-specific internal storage (Wiped on uninstall)

### File Structure

- **Notes**: Stored as individual `.json` files in the `notes/` directory.
- **Images**:
  - **Desktop**: Stored in the `images/` subdirectory.
  - **Mobile**: Stored directly in the app's root data directory for maximum compatibility.

### Mobile Storage Strategy

- **Internal Storage**: On Android, data is stored in the app's protected internal storage (`Directory.Data`).
- **Data Persistence**: Files are preserved across app restarts and updates.
- **Uninstall Data Wipe**: Uninstalling the app automatically and securely wipes all stored data (notes and images) from the device, ensuring no residual files are left behind.

### Maintenance & Cleanup

To keep your storage optimized:

- **Instant Deletion**: When you delete a note, its JSON file is immediately removed from disk.
- **Image Cleanup**: Deleting a note automatically deletes all associated images referenced within it.
- **Manual Control**: Unlike cloud apps that keep "trash" folders, deletion here is permanent and immediate to respect your storage space.
