## 💾 Data Storage & Privacy

Your privacy is paramount. **NBF Notes** stores all data locally on your device using a transparent file structure:

- **Desktop**: `%APPDATA%\nbf-notes`
- **Mobile**: App-specific internal storage

### File Structure

- **Notes**: Stored as individual `.json` files in the `notes/` directory.
- **Images**: Stored as standard image files in the `images/` directory.

### 🧹 Automatic Cleanup

To keep your device clean, the app performs intelligent maintenance:

- **Instant Deletion**: When you delete a note, its file is immediately removed.
- **Image Cleanup**: Deleting a note automatically deletes all its associated images.
- **Orphan Removal**: On every startup, the app scans for "orphan" images (files not referenced by any note) and safely removes them to free up space.
